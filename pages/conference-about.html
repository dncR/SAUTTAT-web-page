          <p class="text-justify text-muted">The International Biometric Society (IBS) is an international society for the advancement of biological science through the development of quantitative theories and the application, development, and dissemination of effective mathematical and statistical techniques. Areas of application of these methods include, for example, agriculture, medicine, bioinformatics, and ecology.</p>
          <p class="text-justify text-muted">The society welcomes members from biology, mathematics, statistics, and similar fields. The IBS is the principal international body of biostatisticians and biometricians and comprises Regions throughout the world. The EMR is the region that was formed in 2001 at the inaugural conference held in Athens, Greece. The Region covers Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, and Türkiye.</p>
          <p class="text-justify text-muted">The latest conference of the EMR was virtual due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The forthcoming conference, the 12th Conference of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the International Biometric Society (IBS) will convene in Izmir, Turkey, on May 8-11, 2023. In addition to the main conference, a mini-symposium will be held before the main conference, which is devoted to the retirement of former EMR presidents <strong>Prof. Refik Burgut</strong> (2001-2003) and <strong>Prof. Ergun Karaagaoglu</strong> (2010-2011).</p>
          <p class="text-justify text-muted">The conference will bring together experts in various disciplines from our Region and all over the world and will provide the opportunity to forge new collaborations, discuss issues of common interest, and plan future developments in biometry, biostatistics, statistics, etc. Besides being of great scientific value in itself, scientific collaboration is one of the ways of enhancing meaningful ties between individuals in different countries and promoting positive and peaceful relationships. We look forward to welcoming you in person in the <strong>EMR2023</strong> conference that is as exciting as our previous conferences held in other EMR region countries.</p>
