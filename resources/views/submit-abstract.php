                <h1>Submission Guideline</h1>
                <p> The selection panel of the scientific committee will consider all abstracts received by the published deadline
                    to ensure that the proposed submission is relevant to the Conference. Abstract selection notifications will be
                    sent out to corresponding authors. All papers will be double-blind peer-reviewed by members of the scientific
                    committee to ensure an adequate standard, that the proposed subject of the submitted abstract has been followed,
                    that the paper is of a suitable length, the standard of English is adequate and the paper is appropriately referenced.
                </p>

                <p> Two types of submission are available, i.e., <bold>Oral Presentation</bold> and <bold>Poster Presentation</bold>.
