                <h1>About the Conference</h1>
                <p> The International Biometric Society (IBS) is an international society for the advancement of
                    biological science
                    through the development of quantitative theories and the application, development, and dissemination
                    of effective
                    mathematical and statistical techniques. Areas of application of these methods include, for example,
                    agriculture,
                    medicine, bioinformatics, and ecology.
                </p>

                <p> The society welcomes members from biology, mathematics, statistics, and similar fields. The IBS is
                    the principal
                    international body of biostatisticians and biometricians and comprises
                    Regions throughout the world. The EMR is the region that was formed in 2001 at the inaugural
                    conference held in
                    Athens, Greece. The Region covers Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority,
                    Saudi Arabia, and Türkiye.
                </p>

                <p> The latest conference of the EMR was virtual due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The forthcoming
                    conference,
                    the 12th Conference of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the International Biometric Society
                    (IBS) will convene
                    in Izmir, Turkey, on May 8-11, 2023. In addition to the main conference, a mini-symposium will be
                    held before the main
                    conference, which is devoted to the retirement of former EMR presidents <strong>Prof. Refik
                        Burgut</strong> (2001-2003) and
                    <strong>Prof. Ergun Karaagaoglu</strong> (2010-2011).
                </p>

                <p> The conference will bring together experts in various disciplines from our Region and all over the
                    world and
                    will provide the opportunity to forge new collaborations, discuss issues of common interest, and
                    plan future
                    developments in biometry, biostatistics, statistics, etc. Besides being of great scientific value in
                    itself,
                    scientific collaboration is one of the ways of enhancing meaningful ties between individuals in
                    different
                    countries and promoting positive and peaceful relationships. We look forward to welcoming you in
                    person in
                    the <strong>EMR2023</strong> conference that is as exciting as our previous conferences held in
                    other EMR region countries.
